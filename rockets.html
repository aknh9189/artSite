      <h1>Rockets</h1>
      <p>This page will tell you all about the progression of the homemade rockets my brother, dad and I have been working on during the 2015/16 school year. These rockets have gone through many revisions and will go though many more! If you have any questions, please get in contact with me!</p>

        <p>This whole project would never have gotten off the ground (literally) without the launcher. A simple pvc pipe was capped off to hold compressed air. One part of the pipe was connected to a bicycle pump and the other to a quick release valve made for sprincklers. The quick release valve is easily triggered using a button and two 9 volt batteries in series, resulting in a large pressure difference and flying rockets.</p>

        <h2>Mk1 Series</h2>
        <p>The Mk1 series rockets were the first designs we tried to launch. These rockets were made out of materials we found around the house (usually paper or plastic, lots of tape). These basic rockets helped us work out the kinks in the rocket building process.</p>
        <p>The rocket in the left two pictures was made of a plastic binder, gurilla tape, and a 3d printed nose cone. </p>

        </div>
        <p>The rockts that took off (and didn't explode under pressure on the launch pad) flew to heights around 50 meters (164 ft). These heights were measured with a protractor, trigonometry, and a pendulum; as well as basic physics calculations based on flight time (ignoring air resistance).</p>
      </div>
      <div id="mk2">
        <h2>Mk2 Series</h2>
        <p>There were two key differences between the Mk1 and Mk2 series. The first was the material; the Mk2 series used thin light plastic tubing bought at a hardware store (as well as lots of gurilla tape). The second distance was the payload of the rocket. The Mk2 series rockets were carrying a datalogger shown in the picture second from the right. More on this later.</p>

        <h3>The Datalogger</h3>
        <img src="rocketMedia/mk2/loggerRaw.jpg" alt="logger image"/>
        <p>The datalogger was made with an arduino pro mini and an pressure/temperature sensor similar to <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11084">this one</a>. The original design (shown on a breadboard to the left) included an accelerometer</p>
