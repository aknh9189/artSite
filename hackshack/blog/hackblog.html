        <h2>A Hack Shack Update</h2>
        <date>11-20-2015</date>
      <p>Have you checked out the Hack Shack yet? Don't know what it is? Check out the video below! Learn from other students what kind of services this place provides.</p>

        <p>Over the past quarter, the Hack Shack has grown. After weeks of planning the Hack Shack opened up to the school, providing students with opprotunities and resourses they couldn't find elsewhere. Since then I've been able to help people design and print chickens,  build annoying car alarms, and explore Italy. The varity of opprotunities offered by the Hack Shack are great, and will just keep expanding. The pictures below show people designing things in Sketchup, as well as a study hall using the Little-Bits. </p>
        <img class="vidPost" alt="people" src="photos/post10/1.jpg"/>
      <p>The varity of projects and ideas the Hack Shack staff see daily continues to amaze us. If someone sets their mind to it, they can learn anything. No matter how intimidating coding or circutry looks, you can learn how to do it. Seeing what people do in the Hack Shack could inspire you to follow a new career path that you woudn't have even considered before. Sound interesting to you? Almost every period of the day, there are people in the Hack Shack who are happy to help you explore new ideas or help you with projects. Come on down!</p>

        <h2>Test Runs and Software</h2>
        <date>11-9-2015</date>
        <p>After hooking everything up and re-soldering the lasers, I started on the software. I just wrote a simple script that takes a picture with each laser turned on, then rotates the plate. There are problems with the stepper motor not moving at random intervals, and to fix this I will look deeper into how the motor works. Besides that I have to decide weather or not I want to use open sourse code for the scanner or learn to write it myself. </p>

        <p>With the building aspect complete, it is time to move on to software. The new camera and cable arrived today, and I should be able to test them. Here is the final design!</p>

        <h2>Last 3D Printed Parts</h2>
        <date>10-29-2015</date>
        <p>Today I printed the last parts for the scanner. After the first camera mount didn't fit, I re-designed the mount. I added a slot
        in the bottom to fit a 20x20 profile. After this was printed (with new fillamint), and the nuts and bolts were bought, I discovered
        that the legs wouldn't hold the scanner steady. I designed simple vertical legs to attach to the 20x20's, and they did the trick. The pictures
        below is the re-designed camera mount. </p>

        <h2>Plan for the 3D Scanner</h2>
        <date>10-20-2015</date>
        <p>The 3D scanner is starting to come together. Parts are starting to fit together, and as they do, I'm starting to realize
         that some pieces need to be reprinted. I want to print: a new motor attachment that has the plate attached to it already, a
         a camera mount with more room for the camera as well as a 20x20 mount, and lastly a properly lengthed 20x20 for the camera elevation.
         After this is done, it's time to move on to the software!</p>

        <h2>Movement and Goals</h2>
        <date>10-13-2015</date>
        <p>This is just a quick update. All the lasers work and I got the Pi to turn the stepper motor. Still need to better understand how the motor works, but will work on that. Besides buying 20x20 profiles and nuts and bolts, the physical side is alomst
          done!</p>

        <h2>Lasers and Media Queries</h2>
        <date>10-10-2015</date>
        <p>The four lasers showed up today. The only concern I have for them is their brightness, as they are only 5mW lasers. It's now time to build the scanner, before we move on to software. I have to pick a couple things up at home depot before construction
          can begin. Besdies organizing, I did a lot of work on making my website compatable with all screen sizes using CSS media queries. </p>

        <date>10-4-2015</date>
        <p>This week was short for me, because I missed one and a half days at the end of the week due to sickness. But during the free time, I worked on a home page for my website, <a href="http://aknh.net">aknh.net</a>. It now re-sizes to fit screen sizes,
          and has an alternate menu, compleatly css based, for smaller screens.</p>

        <h2>The Motor is Here!</h2>
        <date>9-30-2015</date>
        <p>An early suprise! The motor arrived early. It was orederd off ebay, and the arrival date was set to late November, but it showed up really early! It fits very well in the motor mount, as seen in the first picture. Now I can start controlling the
          moter with the Raspberry Pi, and wait for the lasers!</p>

        <h2>Starting the Blog</h2>
        <date>9-27-2015</date>
        <p>
          This will be the first blog post on this blog about my activities with the Hack Shack. We have been discovering our new gadgets, and figuring out how to use everything. This blog is mostly going to be about building a 3d scanner, at least for the first
          couple weeks. I have just finished this site, and all the parts for the 3d scanner have been printed. The lasers for the scanner have not arrived yet.
