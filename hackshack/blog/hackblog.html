        <h2>Projects in the Hack Shack</h2>
        <date>1-13-2015</date>
        <h3>Student Projects</h3>
        <p>Students have created awesome things in the Hack Shack! This quarter during G period I helped run a checker-making workshop, and was amazed with what students came up with. We had students work together to design and 3D print custom checker pieces, and had other students design and create a checker board on the siloette printer! The checker pieces are being printed as I type this, and pictures will be coming soon! This worksop was based off a chess set that a student created from start to finish. A picture of the chess set is below, it really impressed us!</p>

        <h3>Website Update</h3>
        <p>The Hack Shack website got an update! Members from the hack shack have been working on our website to make information more clear and avalible. Check it out <a href="http://orcsd.libguides.com/c.php?g=387718&p=2715421&preview=4074251ed10d9d78a5e562ea8fe1f7aa">here</a>! If you have any comments please stop by! A picture of one of our new pages is below!</p>

        <h3>My projects</h3>
        <div style="margin-left:10px;">
          <h4>3D Scanner</h4>
            <p>The math behind turning 2D images into 3D pointclouds is facinating, and uses some of the concepts I've learned in math, like triganomitry and matricies. I've read several research papers on the subject, and most of the time the math goes right over my head. Receltly I stumbled apon a project on github written in python. By looking at the code I have been able to better understand the process, and hope to start writing my own code soon. A paper illistrating the concept well can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7srhIXbOo__Q2F6NWVxZnJVVDA/view?usp=sharing">here</a> if you're interested. Soon we should be able to scan things!</p>
          <h4>Quadrotor</h4>
            <p>For christmas I got a new IMU! It's a board from sparkfun, combining an accelerometer and gyroscope into one. IMU's use sensors to understand the orientation of the sensor. Most phones have IMU's built into them! Using the workshop <a href="http://physics.rutgers.edu/~aatish/teach/srr/workshop5.pdf">here</a> I was able to gain a better understanding of how IMU's work, and wrote the code for one myself. Check it out if you're interested! A picture of the wiring for the IMU is below</p>
        <img class="vidPost" src="photos/post12/3.jpg"/>
          <h4>Strandbeest</h4>
          <p>A couple weekends ago a couple friends and I went to see an exibat at a muesum featuring these creatures called "Strandbeests" Strandbeests are these crazy moving contraptions. The person who designs them considers them a species, because each year he redesigns the beest, fixing things that didn't work the year before, causing the creature to evolve. In the gift shop of the museum they were selling 3D printed strandbeests for $400, which is a little rediculus. I thought it would be cool to print one for the hack shack, so after a little research I found the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:48087">BraBeest</a>, a 3D-printable version of a strandbeest. I have printed some of the pieces, but the designed pegs are difficult to put together without breaking the plastic. After I find a way to put the pieces together I will print the rest of it, and the hack shack will have its very own Strandbeest! A picture of a full sized Strandbeest is below</p>

        <h3>End of the Quarter</h3>
          <p>The end of the quarter is near, and with the end of the quarter comes midterms! Have to record and edit a movie for your midterm? Come down use our greenscreen! Any Help Desk member would be happy to help you understand video editing software or any other technical problem you run across! Good luck on your finals!</p>

        <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
        <date>12-9-2015</date>
        <p>It's been a while! The next step for the 3D scanner is detecting the lasers, and understanding the information they give me. After spending days, I got openCV installed and running. I was having building errors (because of a missing resourse), but ended up solving it using <a href="http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/15/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-osx/">this</a> guide. I spent time understanding how images work behind the scenes, and how they consist of enourmous lists of rgb values. After doing some more research on three demintanal arrays, I wrote a simple program to find the maximum red value in each line, and put a white dot there. Using this technique I can create a clear contour of the scanned image. A timelapse of a processed partial scan is below. </p>
        <iframe class="vidPost" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RDsGuRl05-I?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
        <p>The next step is to analyze the created contours, and understand the distances the curves represent! I'm looking forward to the challenge. I also added a "preview" feature to the small images. It only uses css, and is a bit problimatic when it comes to multipul images, tell me what you think!</p>

        <p>Over the past quarter, the Hack Shack has grown. After weeks of planning the Hack Shack opened up to the school on October 5th, providing students with opportunities and resources they couldn't find elsewhere. Since then we’ve been able to help people design and print 3D chickens, build annoying car alarms with LittleBits, and explore Italy using the Green Screen. The variety of opportunities offered by the Hack Shack are great, and will just keep expanding. The pictures below shows people designing things in Sketchup, as well as a study hall using the LittleBits.</p>
        <img class="vidPost" alt="people" src="photos/post10/1.jpg"/>
      <p>The variety of projects and ideas the Hack Shack staff see daily continues to amaze us. If someone sets their mind to it, they can learn anything. We’re here to help you find the thing you want to learn about. No matter how intimidating coding or circuitry looks, you can learn how to do it. Seeing what people do in the Hack Shack could inspire you to follow a new career path that you wouldn't have even considered before. Sound interesting to you? Almost every period of the day, there are people in the Hack Shack who are happy to help you explore new ideas or help you with projects. Come on down!</p>

        <h2>Test Runs and Software</h2>
        <date>11-9-2015</date>
        <p>After hooking everything up and re-soldering the lasers, I started on the software. I just wrote a simple script that takes a picture with each laser turned on, then rotates the plate. There are problems with the stepper motor not moving at random intervals, and to fix this I will look deeper into how the motor works. Besides that I have to decide weather or not I want to use open sourse code for the scanner or learn to write it myself. </p>

        <h2>Last 3D Printed Parts</h2>
        <date>10-29-2015</date>
        <p>Today I printed the last parts for the scanner. After the first camera mount didn't fit, I re-designed the mount. I added a slot
        in the bottom to fit a 20x20 profile. After this was printed (with new fillamint), and the nuts and bolts were bought, I discovered
        that the legs wouldn't hold the scanner steady. I designed simple vertical legs to attach to the 20x20's, and they did the trick. The pictures
        below is the re-designed camera mount. </p>

        <h2>Plan for the 3D Scanner</h2>
        <date>10-20-2015</date>
        <p>The 3D scanner is starting to come together. Parts are starting to fit together, and as they do, I'm starting to realize
         that some pieces need to be reprinted. I want to print: a new motor attachment that has the plate attached to it already, a
         a camera mount with more room for the camera as well as a 20x20 mount, and lastly a properly lengthed 20x20 for the camera elevation.
         After this is done, it's time to move on to the software!</p>

        <h2>Movement and Goals</h2>
        <date>10-13-2015</date>
        <p>This is just a quick update. All the lasers work and I got the Pi to turn the stepper motor. Still need to better understand how the motor works, but will work on that. Besides buying 20x20 profiles and nuts and bolts, the physical side is alomst
          done!</p>

        <h2>Lasers and Media Queries</h2>
        <date>10-10-2015</date>
        <p>The four lasers showed up today. The only concern I have for them is their brightness, as they are only 5mW lasers. It's now time to build the scanner, before we move on to software. I have to pick a couple things up at home depot before construction
          can begin. Besdies organizing, I did a lot of work on making my website compatable with all screen sizes using CSS media queries. </p>

        <p>An early suprise! The motor arrived early. It was orederd off ebay, and the arrival date was set to late November, but it showed up really early! It fits very well in the motor mount, as seen in the first picture. Now I can start controlling the
          moter with the Raspberry Pi, and wait for the lasers!</p>

        <date>9-27-2015</date>
        <p>
          This will be the first blog post on this blog about my activities with the Hack Shack. We have been discovering our new gadgets, and figuring out how to use everything. This blog is mostly going to be about building a 3d scanner, at least for the first
          couple weeks. I have just finished this site, and all the parts for the 3d scanner have been printed. The lasers for the scanner have not arrived yet.
